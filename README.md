## What I’m Working On

**ReEntry Compass**
I’m building a mobile-first SaaS tool designed to help returning citizens navigate housing, employment, healthcare, legal aid, and other critical resources.  
It’s being built from lived experience, with a focus on privacy, clarity, and real-world use by nonprofits and agencies.


## The Why

After returning home from prison in December 2024, I made a decision to focus on discipline, consistency, and learning skills that actually create opportunity. I’m teaching myself IT, networking, cybersecurity, and software development while building real tools not just tutorials or throwaway projects.

## Tools & Skills I’m Learning

- Python
- Django
- HTML / CSS
- Basic JavaScript
- Linux (Ubuntu Server)
- Nginx
- SSH, firewalls, system hardening
- Networking basics (DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP)
- Active Directory fundamentals


## What You’ll See in This GitHub

- Projects I’m actively building
- Labs and experiments from networking and security study
- READMEs written in plain language
- Mistakes, fixes, and lessons learned along the way


I focus on understanding *why* things work, not just how to pass a test.
